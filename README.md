# Getting Started in 'ML-Audio'

## About
Audio and acoustics students sometimes ask "How do I get started learning  machine learning?"   This page began after S.H. felt sufficiently embarassed about not having a coherent answer. Until someone creates a "ML for Audio" online course, this page may prove helpful.   


Notes:
- ***This is a collaborative page. Please suggest additions, edits, updates, etc., either via Issues or Pull Requests.***
- This page is bound to be **biased** toward musical audio and deep neural network methods. Inclusion of other domains and methods will depend on your submissions!
- The field advances rapidly. Some topics listed here will be timeless, others will go obsolete.


## Introductory Remarks
"Read all the tutorials and papers you can, watch videos of all the talks you can, try out and modify whatever code you can get your hands on, take whatever courses you can find, go to whatever conferences you can.  Try to build your own system, and spend all your nights and weekends improving it."  

Such was the best advice some of us could give, because it was the path we took. Some of those stories are shared below.  This page is an attempt to offer something more "direct" for newcomers. 

Nevertheless, such reflective narratives may provide helpful perspectives...


## Autobiographical Sketches / Recommendations
Many of us took very different *interdisciplinary* paths, learning from a hodgepodge information, in order complement our existing strengths and fill in gaps in our knowledge.  Here are some stories.

*(Suggestion: try to make submissions conclude with a section on "what you would say to new students.")*

* How `__[your name here]__` got started
* `__[another person]'s__` story
* `__[so-and-so]'s__` suggestions
* Words of wisdom from `__[noted practicioner]__`



## Tutorials
* Andrew Trask's ["Anyone Can Learn To Code an LSTM-RNN in Python"](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/) (is what got S.H. hooked on ML)


## Online ML Courses
* [Andrew Ng's ML Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera (Good all-around ML course)
* [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) (Can get you up and running fast)
* Rebecca Fiebrink's [Machine Learning for Musicians and Artists](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/machine-learning-for-musicians-and-artists/info) on Kadenze  (no math!)
