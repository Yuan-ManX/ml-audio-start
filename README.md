# Getting Started in 'ML-Audio'
Suggestions for students.
## About
Audio and acoustics students sometimes ask "How do I get started learning  machine learning?"  Not everyone gets their start in a major research environment.   

This page began after @drscotthawley felt sufficiently embarassed about not having a coherent answer. Until someone creates a "ML for Audio" online course -- **update 1/7/20:** See Valerio Velardo's ["Deep Learning for Audio"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMqL5vckiU0&list=PL-wATfeyAMNrtbkCNsLcpoAyBBRJZVlnf)! -- this page may prove helpful.


Notes:
- ***This is a collaborative page. Please suggest additions, re-organizations, edits, updates, etc., either via Issues or Pull Requests.***  *(In addition, @drscotthawley may gladly cede control of this content to whichever student or group wants to Wiki-fy it!)*
- This page is bound to be **biased** toward musical audio and deep neural network methods. Inclusion of other domains and methods -- e.g., Gaussian Processes, NMF, RBMs,... -- will depend on your submissions!
- The field advances rapidly. Some topics listed here will be timeless, others will go obsolete.  Such is the nature of the field. Let's try to keep this relevant, at least for "getting started." 


## Introductory Remarks
"Read all the tutorials and papers you can, watch videos of all the talks you can, try out and modify whatever code you can get your hands on, take whatever courses you can find, go to whatever conferences you can.  Try to build your own system, and spend all your nights and weekends improving it."  

This was the best advice some of us could give, because it was the path we took. Some such stories are shared below.  This page is an attempt to offer something more "direct" for newcomers. 

Nevertheless, a few reflective narratives may provide helpful perspectives...


## Essays / Reflections / Autobiographical Sketches
Many practicioners took very different *interdisciplinary* paths, learning from a hodgepodge of information, in order to complement their existing strengths and fill in gaps in their knowledge.  Here are some stories.

*(For submissions: Either link to elsewhere on the web, or add a file to the repo via PR. Try to make submissions conclude with a section on what you would say to new students.)*

* How `__[someone]__` got started 
* `__[a young person]'s__` story 
* The *N*-step Process that `__[this person]__` thinks all students should follow
* `__[a long-time veteran]'s__` view of the field 
* Where `__[a hot-shot postdoc]__` thinks the field is heading 
* Things `__[so-and-so]__` wishes someone had told him/her
* ...your name(s) here!...**Chris Donahue, Christian Steinmetz, Jordi Pons, Keunwoo Choi, Faro, Justin Salomon,...?**


## Quick Quotes
* [Justin Salomon](https://twitter.com/justin_salamon/status/1202016519720300545): "Anyone working in ML, *anyone*, should be *obliged* to curate a dataset before they're allowed to train a single model. The lessons learnt in the process are invaluable, and the dangers of skipping said lessons are manifold (see what I did there?)"
* `__[so-and-so]'s__` suggestion
* A nugget of wisdom from `__[noted practicioner]__`
